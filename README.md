# NYC Parks Check
NYC Parks Check

## Project Description: 
NYC Parks Check will be a Web app that will provide all sort of information about local parks, such as: events, playgrounds, dog parks, grills for summer, etc. The app will use publicly available open data and APIs from the NYC government open data portal, and will make it presentable and searchable in a one-stop shop for users. It will also subscribe to parks RSS feeds (when available) for live updates 
on events.

## Requirement 1
- Step 1:
Coding language - write in c++ then transfer in html, html is the main language used for project.

Once the section "maps" is clicked on on the main page, it will take you to a new page that offer selections of the name of the park in the selected area along with a recognizable view of the park on the side of selections (main page -> click on the button "name of the park" -> informative page about the park will be displayed )
-Add a button that sends you to another webpage (utilize w3schools to figure out how to do so)
-figure out how to input images onto the html page from my files.

-what will happen once a park is selected?
Finally once a park is selected, a search bar (located on the top), the address, directions, ratings,  a picture of the area along with a short paragraph will be displayed on the bottom half of the screen.

Hyperlinks will be on "Directions" and the address, and ratings.

Provided a next and previous page, but instead of it saying "previous page" and "next page" it will say the "main page" and the name of the next page.



//a map of new york, different sections and parts of the area will be seperatly shaded in. above picture of the park via maps app (satalite view), will be highlighted in a specific color.

## Requirement 2

Find a way to convert Requirement 1 to HTML.
Find out what parks you want to include onto the website so that you can make a seperate page to inform the user about the specific park and reveal its ratings that the park was rated from the public.

## Requirement 3

Going to convert the c++ to the recommended coding language (most likely or JavaScript.

## Requirement 1: Search Data

- Step 1: Find publicly available open data and APIs from NYC government open data portal and possibly other sources.
- Step 2: Using Python or C++ integrate the data sources into the search function so the most relevant information shows up when users search for something. Possibly also implementing search sugestions that show beneath the search bar when typing.


## Requirement 2: UI/UX & Front End

- Step 1: Design a UI/UX plan/map using Figma to decide how to best present information to the users and make navigating the site/app easy and visually appealing.
- Step 2: Once design plan is finalized, use JavaScript or another language to build the front end and make sure all features are functional and properly linked to the back end.

## Documentation Submission

A:

I first completed the Figma UI/UX map and constructed how each page would look, where contnent would be placed on each page and what the functionalities of the page elements would be. I also used Figma to keep the group organized and keep track of who was working on what page. We also communicated questions,answers and ideas in the Figma chat. After this I researched and read through the APIs from NYC government open data portal and Google Maps API and learned how we could implement each into our project. Ultimately I decided Google Maps APi was the most user friendly and intuitive API to use so that is what I integrated into the Maps page for the interactive map of New York City.

B:

The Maps page includes a search bar with a "Search" button. The seach bar includes text suggestiing things the user woul most likely want to search the website for. Once clicked and typed in, the suggestions dissapear to allow for the search input to be properly readable. The searching functionality however does not work at this time. The Maps page also includes five buttons for each borough of New York City. The buttons do not function but they were planned to zoom in on the map and display parks in the selected borough. The Maps page also includes an interactive map section that is automatically defaulted to showing the New York City area using Google Maps API. This section includes several functions including zooming in and out, viewing the map in 2D and 3D, selecting places that include links to get directions, view reviews, or view in a larger map page.

## Requirement 1: Search Functionality

- Step 1: Implement search functionality that will allow users to find parks and related information based on criteria like location.
- Step 2: Design this search page to be user friendly and make it look park related.

  By using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, I am able to create a page that is searchable and designed in relation to parks. The importance of this would be allowing users to find local parks in NYC and viewing which parks they may or may not like. For my part of the project I am working on the welcome page (first page) of the project and every page that has the search functionality.

  The impact of this website would be making it convienient for people to search for parks and that it should not be stressful for them. Each page has the required tools to help users out, navigating them in a user friendly way. There is the "maps" button on the main page redirecting them to the maps page where they will be able to view the parks in their respective borough. Then there is the "events" button taking you to the page where you will get information about the events at parks if available. There is the "parks" button taking you to a page where there is specific info about specific parks.


## Requirement 2: Events Page

- Step 1: Implement code to link the index.html file to another file that will contain html code to the events page.
- Step 2: Find information about possible events at local NYC parks.
- Step 3: Design the events page to be user friendly.

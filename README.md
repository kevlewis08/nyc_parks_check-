# NYC Parks Check
NYC Parks Check

## Project Description: 
NYC Parks Check will be a Web app that will provide all sort of information about local parks, such as: events, playgrounds, dog parks, grills for summer, etc. The app will use publicly available open data and APIs from the NYC government open data portal, and will make it presentable and searchable in a one-stop shop for users. It will also subscribe to parks RSS feeds (when available) for live updates 
on events.

## Requirement 1
- Step 1:
Coding language - c++ and/or html,

Once the section "maps" is clicked on on the main page, it will take you to a new page that offer selections of the name of the park in the selected area along with a recognizable view of the park on the side of selections (main page -> click on "maps" -> list of 5 boroughs show up (only the map of the borough will be displayed next to the name of the borough) -> once a borough is selected the list of known parks will appear under the borough name.
-Add a button that sends you to another webpage (utilize w3schools to figure out how to do so)
-figure out how to input custom images onto the page from my phone (planned on placing the highlighted images from my phone next to the name of the borough and the park after being clicked on.)

-what will happen once a park is selected?
Finally once a park is selected, a slideshow will play of all community pictures and pictures of the area.
under the slideshow will reveal the address to the park, an overall rating of 5 stars and reviews from people that have visted, and local mta/train stops that are nearby the area.

Task for c++:
"rated reviews from people that have visited" will also be on the site.
    - Produce random reviews using a random function. (done) 
    - Random function for amount of reviews shown (at least 5-10 reviews for each park), (random functions is complete, the amount of reviews for each park is still something to be worked on. I plan on making a random function for each park but it make more sense to just leave it how it is.) 
    - Over 30 reviews (10 for each one which is good, bad, average) will be listed in code for random to decide and can be used but when the review is displayed there will be different names that will show with the review. all I have to do is add more reviews.


Example Model:
Stars Given: 4
Random_firstname, Random_lastname:
(produce an if statement, if the stars given is <=2 out of 5 print random bad_review.)
(produce an if statement, if the stars given is >3 out of 5, print random good_review.) 
(finished this model, added average for it the star being given was 3.)



//a map of new york, different sections and parts of the area will be seperatly shaded in. above picture of the park via maps app (satalite view), will be highlighted in a specific color.

## Requirement 2

Find a way to convert Requirement 1 to HTML.
Find out what parks you want to include on the webside so you can take the satalite pictures from the "maps" app on your phone and add them to the site.

## Requirement 1: Search Data

- Step 1: Find publicly available open data and APIs from NYC government open data portal and possibly other sources.
- Step 2: Using Python or C++ integrate the data sources into the search function so the most relevant information shows up when users search for something. Possibly also implementing search sugestions that show beneath the search bar when typing.


## Requirement 2: UI/UX & Front End

- Step 1: Design a UI/UX plan/map using Figma to decide how to best present information to the users and make navigating the site/app easy and visually appealing.
- Step 2: Once design plan is finalized, use JavaScript or another language to build the front end and make sure all features are functional and properly linked to the back end.

## Requirement 1: Search Functionality

- Step 1: Implement search functionality that will allow users to find parks and related information based on criteria like location.
- Step 2: Design this search page to be user friendly and make it look park related.


## Requirement 2: Events Page

- Step 1: Implement code to link the index.html file to another file that will contain html code to the events page.
- Step 2: Find information about possible events at local NYC parks.
- Step 3: Design the events page to be user friendly.

NYC Parks Check

## Project Description: 
NYC Parks Check will be a Web app that will provide all sort of information about local parks, such as: events, playgrounds, dog parks, grills for summer, etc. The app will use publicly available open data and APIs from the NYC government open data portal, and will make it presentable and searchable in a one-stop shop for users. It will also subscribe to parks RSS feeds (when available) for live updates 
on events.
